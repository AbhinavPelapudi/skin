# jquery-focus-exit

Triggers 'focusexit' event when keyboard focus has completely left the element.

This type of behaviour is especially desirable for non-modal overlays.

JavaScript's native 'focusout' event fires when any decendant of a given element
loses keyboard focus, even if another decendant immediately gains focus. This type
of behaviour is not desirable for non-modal overlays.

```js
// init plugin
$(collection).focusExit();

// handle event
$(collection).on('focusexit', function(e) {
    console.log(e.lostFocus, e.gainedFocus);
})
```
