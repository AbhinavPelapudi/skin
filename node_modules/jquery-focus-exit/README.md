# jquery-focus-exit v0.0.2

Triggers 'focusexit' event when keyboard focus has completely left the element.

This type of behaviour is especially desirable for non-modal overlays.

JavaScript's native 'focusout' event fires when any decendant of a given element
loses keyboard focus, even if another decendant immediately gains focus. This type
of behaviour is not desirable for non-modal overlays.

```js
// init plugin
$(collection).focusExit();

// handle event
$(collection).on('focusexit', function(e) {
    console.log(e.lostFocus, e.gainedFocus);
})
```

## Experimental

This plugin is still in an experimental state, until it reaches v1.0.0 you must consider all minor releases as breaking changes. Patch releases may introduce new features, but will be backwards compatible.

Please use the tilde range specifier in your package.json to pin to a fixed major and minor version.
