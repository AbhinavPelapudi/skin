# jquery-keyboard-trap v0.1.3

Prevents keyboard focus from leaving the confines of an element.

## Experimental

This plugin is still in an experimental state, until it reaches v1.0.0 you must consider all minor releases as breaking changes. Patch releases may introduce new features, but will be backwards compatible.

Please use the tilde range specifier in your package.json to pin to a fixed major and minor version.

### Install

```js
npm install jquery-keyboard-trap --save
```

### Use

To trap:

```js
$.trapKeyboard(el, [options]);
```

To untrap:

```js
$.untrapKeyboard();
```

### Options

`deactivateOnFocusExit`: deactivate the keyboard trap when clicking outside of keyboard trap. Default: true.

### Notes

Keyboard-trap is a singleton as there can only ever be one active
keyboard-trap on a page. Creating a new keyboard-trap will disable the
current trap.

This plugin does not trap mouse focus! i.e. it does not prevent mouse user from
clicking outside of keyboard trap to set focus elsewhere. By default the trap
will be deactivated in this case.

If you want to trap mouse focus too, checkout the jquery-focus-trap which extends
this plugin.

## Development

Run `npm start` for test driven development. All tests are located in `test.js`.

Execute `npm run` to view all available CLI scripts.

### Reports

Each test run will generate the following reports:

* `jshint.xml` contains JSHint checkstyle report
* `/coverage` contains Istanbul code coverage report
* `/karma_html` contains Karma HTML test report
* `/target` contains Karma JUnit test report
