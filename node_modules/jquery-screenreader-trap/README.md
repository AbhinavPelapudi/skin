# jquery-screenreader-trap

Prevents screen reader's virtual cursor from leaving the confines of an element.

Screenreader-trap is a singleton as there can only ever be one active
screenreader-trap on a page. Creating a new screenreader-trap will disable the
current trap.

```js
$.trapScreenreader($el);
$.untrapScreenreader();
```

## Install

```js
npm install jquery-screenreader-trap --save
```

## Events

* on.screenreaderTrap : fired when screenreader trap is activated
* off.screenreaderTrap : fired when screenreader trap is deactivated

## Develop
